You can see where master bedroom is, a small projection from the main building on the first floor. You know it's probably not empty at this time of day; Akiyo takes a while to get herself ready in the morning. Something to do with 'all these stupid tails needing grooming,' last you checked.<p>To your south, you see the little building that houses Hakkin's general store. You're always struck by how it seems way bigger on the inisde. At this time of day, there's a good amount of business from people either stocking up on small things like rations for the road or supplies to repair broken wheels.",
